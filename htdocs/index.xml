    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>
      Pyzor is a collaborative, networked system to detect
      and block spam using identifying digests of messages.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Pyzor initially started out to be merely a Python
      implementation of <a href="http://razor.sourceforge.net/">Razor</a>,
      but due to the protocol and the fact that Razor's server
      is not Open Source or software libre,
      I decided to impelement Pyzor with a new protocol and release the entire system
      as Open Source and software libre.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Since the entire system is released under the GPL, people are free
      to host their own independent servers.  Server peering is
      planned for a future release.
    </p>
