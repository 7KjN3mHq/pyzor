    <h1>Pyzor</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>
      Pyzor is a Python implementation of a spam-blocking
      networked system that use spam signatures to identify them.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Pyzor initially started out to be merely a Python
      implementation of <a href="http://razor.sourceforge.net/">Razor</a>,
      but due to the protocol and the fact that Razor's server
      is not Free Software, I decided to Pyzor should be based
      upon a new, lighter, more language-independent protocol.
    </p>
