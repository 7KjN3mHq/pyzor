    <h1>Pyzor</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>
      Pyzor is a Python implementation of a spam-blocking
      networked system that use spam signatures to identify them.
      Concentrations will be on a clear, language-independent,
      lightweight specification.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Pyzor will contain both a client and server for the protocol.
      The protocol will be designed and documented such that
      it is not tied to the implementation.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Pyzor initially started out to be merely a Python
      implementation of <a href="http://razor.sourceforge.net/">Razor</a>,
      but due to the protocol and the fact that Razor's server
      is not Free Software, I decided to Pyzor should be based
      upon a new protocol.
    </p>
    
    <h2>For Users</h2>
    
    <p>
      As of yet, there has been no release of Pyzor.  However, I plan
      to produce a release by 2002-04-15.  You are welcome to
