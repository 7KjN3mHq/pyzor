    <h1>Pyzor</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>
      Pyzor is a collaborative, networked system to detect
      and block spam using identifying digests of messages.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Pyzor initially started out to be merely a Python
      implementation of <a href="http://razor.sourceforge.net/">Razor</a>,
      but due to the protocol and the fact that Razor's server
      is not Free Software, I decided to Pyzor should be based
      upon a new, lighter, more language-independent protocol.
    </p>
    
    <h2>For Users</h2>
    
    <p>
      Feel free to <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=50000">download Pyzor</a>
      and join the pyzor-announce or pyzor-users
      <a href="https://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=50000">mailing
	lists</a>.  All users are recommended to join the pyzor-announce
      list, as information about new releases and popular public servers
      will be posted to it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Users are encouraged to read <a href="blocking.html">Steps
	to block spam with Pyzor</a> so they are aware of how
      Pyzor should fit into their overall scheme, and to realize
      that Pyzor is meant to <em>complement</em> other techniques.
    </p>
