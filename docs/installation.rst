Installation
==============

Easiest way to install Pyzor is with pip::

    pip install pyzor

You can also download the latest or older version from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyzor/>`_, and extract and install manually::

    python setup.py install

.. note::

   Note that the latest version requires at least Python 2.6.6

The Pyzor code will also work on Python3, but requires refactoring done with the 2to3 tool. This has been integrated in the setup, so installation in Python3 now works seamlessly with any method described above.
