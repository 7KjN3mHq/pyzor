Noteworthy changes in 0.4.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    *	The pyzor system now has accounts, access controls on
	users.  anonymous users by default can do
	['check', 'report', 'ping', 'info'].
	For more information on this, please refer to the
	documentation.

    *	Documentation has moved from the source files
	(e.g., 'pydoc pyzor') into a separate XHTML document,
	located in docs/index.html, and normally installed
	into a location such as /usr/share/doc/pyzor

    *	Messages are authenticated using digest-signing, similar
	to HTTP-digest authentication.  This is a
	is a shared-secret scheme, but no part of the
	secret is not passed in the message.

    *	Whitelisting messages is now possible.

    *	An 'info' command is no implemented
	This returns extra info about any digest, such as
	when it was first entered and last updated.

    *	a 'genkey' command has been implemented for the client;
	this is used to create a (salt, key) string
	used for authentication.

    *	a 'shutdown' commmand has been implemented, which can
	be used to shutdown a server.

    *	Expiring of digests using a USR1 signal has bee removed
	for now.  In the future a client/server message
	will be likely be implemented for this functionality.
